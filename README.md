## Overview

---

In this repository we have done A/B testing using machine learning on a dataset of users who were shown a creative ad made by the company SmartAd. This project is part of 10 academy's training week 2 challenge.

## Scenario

An advertising company is running an online ad for a client with the intention of increasing brand awareness. The advertiser company earns money by charging the client based on user engagements with the ad it designed and serves via different platforms. To increase its market competitiveness, the advertising company provides a further service that quantifies the increase in brand awareness as a result of the ads it shows to online users. The main objective of this project is to test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.
